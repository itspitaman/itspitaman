I'm a Game Developer who is passionate about making 3D and VR games; focusing mostly on team-based competitive games and also casual couch-friendly games. Some of the tools that I love to work with include:

### Unity Engine / Procreate / Adobe Illustrator / Adobe Premiere Rush

My interest in the now called Meta Quest 2 (previously known as the Oculus Quest 2), made me want to learn how to develop games for the Metaverse and how to bring the competitiveness of team-based games to VR. In 2022, I decided to venture into the XR Industry by learning VR Game Development in Unity. Here you will see all the projects I've worked on!

### Latest VR Project: Kindled Spirits VR
